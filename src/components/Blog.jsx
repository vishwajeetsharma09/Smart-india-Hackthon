            What is Cyber Crime in India?
    
            In India, cyber crime can be defined as a crime or an unlawful act where the computer is used either as a tool, a target or both. In other terms, cyber crimes in India can be defined as an unauthorized access to some computer system without the permission of rightful owner or place of criminal activity and include everything from online cracking to denial of service attacks.
    
            Some examples of cyber crime include phishing, spoofing, DoS (Denial of Service) attack, credit card fraud, online transaction fraud, cyber defamation, child pornography, etc.
    
            Causes of Cyber Crime in India
    
            <div style={{ marginTop: '19px' }}>Cybercriminals always choose an easy way to make big money. They target rich people or rich organizations like banks, casinos and financial firms where the transaction of a huge amount of money is made on an everyday basis and hack sensitive information.
    
            Catching such criminals is difficult. Hence, that increases the number of cyber-crimes. Computers are vulnerable, so laws are required to protect and safeguard them against cyber criminals. Following are the reasons for the vulnerability of computers:
    
                Easy to access – The problem behind safeguarding a computer system from unauthorized access is that there are many possibilities of breach due to the complex technology. Hackers can steal access codes, retina images, advanced voice recorders etc. that can easily fool biometric systems and bypass firewalls can be utilized to get past many security systems.
    
                Capacity to store data in comparatively small space – The computer has the unique characteristic of storing data in a very small space. This makes it a lot easier for people to steal data from any other storage device and use it for their own profit.
    
                Complex – The computers run on operating systems and these operating systems are programmed of millions of codes. The human mind is imperfect, so they can do mistakes at any stage. The cyber criminals take advantage of these gaps.
    
                Negligence – Negligence is one of the characteristics of human conduct. So, there may be a possibility that protecting the computer system we may make any negligence which provides a cyber-criminal the access and control over the computer system.
    
                Loss of Evidence – The data related to the crime can be easily destroyed. So, Loss of evidence has become a very common & obvious problem which paralyzes the system behind the investigation of cyber-crimes.

                    Types of Cyber Crime in India
            
                    Cyber crime can be committed in two ways - one in which the computer is the target of a cyber attack, and the other in which the computer is used to commit a cyber crime against any person or entity.
            
                    Cyber crimes in India are categorised into main four types which include:
            
                        Cyber crime against a person: This type of cyber crime is committed against a person using an electronic domain as a medium. Cyber crime against a person includes:
            
                        Cyber stalking: Generally, the term ‘stalking’ means,  repeated acts of harassing someone. Whereas, Cyber stalking is online harassment when a person is stalked using the internet as a medium. Generally, the stalker is aware of the victim or gains knowledge about victim’s family and their activities,  instead of stalking them in reality, the stalker keeps a track of a person’s online activities to stalk the victim. A Stalker can use the internet, emails, SMS, webcams, phones calls, websites or even videos to harass his target.
            
                        Hacking: Hacking means getting unauthorised access to someone’s personal information stored in a computer system without the permission of either rightful owner of the computer or person in charge of that particular system for illegal gains or misuse. Every act committed to breaking into a computer system and /or network is hacking.  Hackers get access to the user’s personal and sensitive information. They can also monitor every online activity of a person like logging in, credentials added, banking transactions made, etc.
            
                        Cracking: Crack generally refers to the means of achieving software cracking. Cracking refers to digitally removing the Copyright protection code which prevents copied or pirated software from working on computers which do not have the Software vendor or owner’s authorisation. The person who is involved in such activity is different from a hacker and is known as a cracker. Cracker uses his knowledge to break the cyber law and tampers with the computer.
            
                        Defamation: Online or cyber defamation involves damaging someone’s reputation in society using a computer or the internet as a medium. This is done by writing a derogatory statement about a person on social media, posting vulgar pictures or videos, sending derogatory E-mail to the victim’s friends, etc.
            
                        Online Fraud: Online fraud is one of the most common types of cyber crime. It involves stealing a person’s sensitive information like banking credentials by using phishing sites and withdrawing money from the victim’s account.

                        Spoofing: Spoofing involves misrepresentation of the origin of any data. While an Email/SMS is generated from one source, it shows that it has been generated from another. Cyber criminals use this means to get personal information of the user like bank details, etc.
            
                        Phishing: It involves sending spam emails to the user while claiming to be an established enterprise in order to obtain his personal information.

                <div style={{ marginTop: '19px' }}>How to Prevent Cyber Crime?
        
                To deal with the situation of cyber crime effectively, one needs to establish multi-dimensional public-private collaborations between law enforcement agencies, the information technology industry, information security organizations, internet companies, and financial institutions.
        
                Unlike the real world, cyber criminals do not fight one another for supremacy or control. Instead, they work together to improve their skills and even help out each other with new opportunities. Hence, the usual methods of fighting crime cannot be used against cyber crimes in India.
        
                    Use Strong Passwords: Use the different password and username combinations for different accounts and resist the temptation to write them down.
        
                    Keep Your social media accounts private: Be sure that you keep your social networking profiles (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc.) private. Be sure to check your security settings. Be careful of what information you post online. Once it is on the Internet it is there forever.
        
                    Secure your Mobile Devices: Many people are not aware that their mobile devices are also vulnerable to malicious software, such as computer viruses and hackers. Be sure to download applications only from trusted sources. It is also crucial that you keep your operating system up-to-date. Be sure to install anti-virus software and to use a secure lock screen as well. Otherwise, anyone can access all your personal information on your phone if you misplace it or even set it down for a few moments. Someone could even install malicious software that could track your every movement through your GPS.
        
                    Protect your data: Protect your data by using encryption for your most sensitive files such financial records and tax returns.
        
                    Protect your identity online: When it comes to protecting your identity online it is better to be too cautious than not cautious enough. It is critical that you be cautious when giving out personal ID such as your name, address, phone number and/or financial information on the Internet. Be certain to make sure websites are secure when making online purchases, etc. This includes enabling your privacy settings when using/accessing social networking sites.
        
                    Keep your computer current with the latest patches and updates: One of the best ways to keep attackers away from your computer is to apply patches and other software fixes when they become available. By regularly updating your computer, you block attackers from being able to take advantage of software flaws (vulnerabilities) that they could otherwise use to break into your system.
        
                    Protect your computer with security software: Several types of security software are necessary for basic online security. Security software essentials include firewall and antivirus programs. A firewall is usually your computer’s first line of defense. It controls who and what can communicate with your computer online. You could think of a firewall as a sort of “policeman” that watches all the data attempting to flow in and out of your computer on the Internet, allowing communications that it knows are safe and blocking “bad” traffic such as attacks from ever reaching your computer.
